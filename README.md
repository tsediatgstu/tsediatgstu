Professional summary
--------------------
I am a disciplined and pragmatic Full‑Stack Web Developer with a Computer Science degree. I build secure, maintainable, and high‑performance web applications—bridging backend systems and polished frontends. My approach focuses on clear API design, efficient data modeling, production readiness, and measurable impact.

Key strengths
-------------
- System design with a focus on scalability, security, and observability.
- End‑to‑end web application development (React / Next.js, Node.js, FastAPI).
- Data modeling and query optimization for MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL.
- Strong engineering practices: TDD, CI/CD, containerization (Docker), and code review.

Professional highlights
-----------------------
- Architected a University Student Credential Card Management System using the MERN stack; implemented indexing and query optimizations that improved data retrieval latency by ~40% and enforced role‑based access with JWT.
- Delivered a Student Complaint Management System with a Redux‑driven client and a PHP/MySQL backend to support legacy workflows and transactional integrity.
- Experienced at producing production‑ready systems: monitoring, secure defaults, backups, and deployment automation.

Technical skills
----------------
- Frontend: React, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, FastAPI, PHP
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Languages: JavaScript / TypeScript, Python, Java, C++
- DevOps & Tooling: Docker, Git, GitHub Actions (CI), Nginx
- Practices: REST / GraphQL APIs, JWT auth, indexing & query optimization, unit/integration testing, Redux

Selected projects
-----------------
University Student Credential Card Management System
- Secure digital identity and credential delivery for students.
- Performance: MongoDB indexing + query tuning to reduce fetch latency.
- Security: Role‑based access control, JWT, encrypted storage of sensitive fields.

Student Complaint Management System
- Cross‑platform ticketing solution to improve student–faculty communication.
- Robust client state management with Redux; backend built on PHP/MySQL to support legacy data and ACID operations.
